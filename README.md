# Pokemon
In this text-based RPG you will enter the world of Pokemon where you can visit Arupville, Kriaustin Town, or the Wilderness and can encounter Pokemon! You can choose to battle or release these Pokemon of different strength and rarity. Win the battle, and you get to keep the Pokemon in your inventory to use in furture battles (after restoring their health, of course). You can even save your progress and load your game later!

_This is my first ever pogramming project. I made it with a partner for the final submission in my Intro to C class (my very first programming class).We were not given much intruction other than to create something using everything we had learned the past semester. While it is not as impressive as my other projects, I have included it here as it is very special to me._
